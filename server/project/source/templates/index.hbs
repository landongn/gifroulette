	<h2>This site is not really safe for work.</h2>

	<p>It does not moderate, change, or in any way processes any data. It's whatever the live feed is according to when and what it scrapes.</p>

	<p>Do not expect any kind of NSFW tags or hidden previews (yet).</p>
	<p>this means that sometimes, you might (Haha, okay, <i>will</i>) see pornography.</p>
